# Catastrophe Risk Ontology (CRO)

## Overview

The **Catastrophe Risk Ontology (CRO)** is a formal knowledge representation designed to **unify and contextualize catastrophe-related data** across various perils, regions, lines of business, and accident years within the (re)insurance sector. It addresses the significant challenges posed by fragmented and siloed datasets‚Äîoften stored in disparate formats and lacking semantic alignment‚Äîthat lead to valuable information being underutilized. CRO transforms disparate data sources into **coherent, enterprise-wide data assets** that support advanced catastrophe analytics, portfolio risk monitoring, and loss benchmarking.

## Why CRO? Addressing Key Challenges

Catastrophe risk management demands the integration of diverse datasets, including claims, exposure, and catastrophe modeling outputs. However, in practice, this process is non-trivial due to:
*   **Data Fragmentation and Silos**: Claims and modeling data are often siloed and embedded within enterprise data models, making them difficult to collect, integrate, and reconcile across different market geographies and regulatory requirements.
*   **Semantic Heterogeneity**: Lack of a well-defined taxonomy means challenges in unifying data and enabling advanced analytics, as terms in claims and modeling data feeds may have differing meanings.
*   **Nontrivial Data Comparison**: Comparing claims data to catastrophe modeling results is complex due to evolving portfolios, inflation, and the presence of **Non-Modeled Risks (NMR)**‚Äîlosses from hazards, subperils, regions, exposure, or coverage classes not considered by the models.
*   **Integration with Emerging Technologies**: The need for structured knowledge to ground generative AI systems and reduce "hallucinations" in Large Language Model (LLM) outputs.

## Key Features and Capabilities

CRO provides a robust framework to overcome these challenges, offering several advantages:

*   **Enterprise-wide Data Integration**: Harmonizes claims, exposure, and catastrophe model outputs into a consistent, long-term dataset across multiple years, lines of business, perils, and regions.
*   **Enhanced Knowledge Management**: Creates a **structured knowledge layer** for diverse data, supporting semantic interoperability across different stakeholders (insurers, reinsurers, brokers, model vendors) and reducing reliance on intensive ETL processes.
*   **Advanced Catastrophe Analytics**:
    *   **Multi-dimensional Loss Analysis**: Enables breakdowns by event, line of business, peril, region, paid losses, reserves, and loss components.
    *   **Evaluation of Non-Modeled Risks (NMR)**: Supports identification of patterns and computation of corresponding risk loads for losses not covered by models.
    *   **Portfolio Performance Monitoring**: Tracks risk metrics over time by peril, geography, and line of business.
    *   **Model Validation**: Enables granular analysis of vulnerability across building characteristics (e.g., construction, occupancy, floor area) and robust model evaluation.
    *   **Normalizing Historical Losses**: Adjusts past claims for changes in exposure, cost inflation, and other factors to enable meaningful comparisons.
*   **LLM Integration and Generative AI Applications**:
    *   **Grounding Generative AI**: Provides validated domain expertise to LLMs, **improving natural language querying and reducing hallucinations**.
    *   **Semantic Search and Natural Language Querying**: Unlocks new applications such as semantic search across risk data and supports **free-text interaction with the knowledge base**.
    *   **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Facilitates the development of "chat-with-data" applications that translate natural language questions into precise SPARQL queries, execute them on the CRO knowledge graph, and summarize results.
*   **Flexibility and Extensibility**: Its dynamic schema allows for **rapid incorporation of new risks, perils, or regulatory requirements** without major redesigns, an essential capability in the fast-changing catastrophe risk landscape.

## Core Components of CRO

Formally, an ontology like CRO is expressed as a tuple ùëÇ = „Äàùê∂, ùëÖ, ùëÉ, ùêº„Äâ:
*   **C (Concepts)**: Fundamental categories of entities, such as `Disaster Event`, `Peril`, `Geographic Region`, `Catastrophe Model`, `Accident Year`, `Incurred Loss`, or `Modeled Result`.
*   **R (Relationships)**: Links between concepts, defining how entities are connected (e.g., a `Disaster Event` occurs in a `Region`, a `Claim` is associated with an `Exposure Asset`).
*   **P (Properties)**: Attributes and constraints describing each concept (e.g., a `Disaster Event` has a unique ID, start date, and end date).
*   **I (Instances)**: The actual data points populating the ontology's abstract framework with real-world information, expressed as a knowledge graph.

The CRO systematically captures and organizes core concepts of catastrophe risk, including `peril`, `region`, `event`, `hazard`, `claim`, `policy`, `account`, `portfolio`, `catastrophe model`, and key result metrics like `AAL` and `PML`. It is built upon foundational ontologies like TIME and GEOSPARQL and includes modules for **Region, Peril, Incurred Loss (Claims Data), Exposure Data, Catastrophe Modeling**, and **Aggregation Vectors**.

## Ontology-driven Knowledge Management System

CRO serves as the conceptual layer for an ontology-driven knowledge management system (KMS). This system integrates and normalizes data from relevant sources (claims, model outputs, metadata), maps it into a unified knowledge graph structure, and provides user interaction tools. It leverages **Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL)** for logical reasoning, enabling automatic inference of new knowledge (e.g., identifying Non-Modeled Risks) and continuous monitoring of data consistency.

The system supports powerful querying capabilities using **SPARQL**, which exploits the graph structure and semantics of relationships to enable complex, inference-driven queries.

## Case Studies and Demonstrations

A case study involving a hypothetical property insurer demonstrates how CRO-powered knowledge graphs can:
*   **Reconcile modeled and incurred losses**.
*   **Track patterns in non-modeled risks**.
*   Support the development of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems powered by LLMs** for catastrophe risk analytics and management.
*   Answer complex **competency questions** such as comparing incurred loss to modeled Average Annual Loss (AAL) for specific perils and regions, determining observed loss return periods, and summarizing non-modeled losses.

The integration with LLMs (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-4o) allows for **natural language questions to be translated into precise SPARQL queries**, executed on the CRO knowledge graph, and summarized to deliver relevant analytical results.

## Accessing the Ontology

The Catastrophe Risk Ontology (CRO) is published in TTL (‚ÄúTerse RDF Triple Language‚Äù) format and can be accessed at:
*   **Ontology TTL format**: [https://w3id.org/catrisk/ontology/](https://w3id.org/catrisk/ontology/)
*   **Supporting documentation and examples**: [https://github.com/catriskscientist/catrisk-ontology](https://github.com/catriskscientist/catrisk-ontology)

## Future Work

Future work aims to build on this foundation by creating a **family of application-specific ontologies**, tailored to particular stakeholders or use cases (e.g., reinsurers, brokers, ILS firms), in collaboration with subject-matter experts. Integration with Large Language Models (LLMs) is a promising frontier, exploring how LLMs can **extract, structure, and codify valuable information from unstructured sources** (e.g., reports, documentation, adjuster notes) to further enhance the knowledge graph itself.
