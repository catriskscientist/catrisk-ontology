# catrisk-ontology
The CatRisk Ontology is a domain-specific vocabulary designed to model, integrate, and analyze data related to catastrophe risk in the property and casualty insurance domain. 

The Catastrophe Risk Ontology (CRO) is designed to address key analysis needs within (re)insurance companies, including:

•	Enterprise data integration — harmonizing claims, exposure, and catastrophe model outputs into a consistent, long‑term dataset.
•	Multi‑dimensional loss analysis — by event, line of business, peril, and region, including breakdowns by paid losses, reserves, and loss components.
•	Evaluation of non‑modeled risks — identifying patterns and computing corresponding risk loads.
•	Portfolio performance monitoring — tracking risk metrics over time by peril, geography, and line of business.
•	Event severity assessment — using observed loss return periods.
•	Traceability and auditability — linking claims back to events and their corresponding catastrophe models.
•	Granular model validation — enabling analysis of vulnerability across building characteristics (e.g., construction, occupancy, floor area).
•	Third‑party data integration — incorporating event footprints, industry loss reports, model documentation, and validation results.
•	Natural language querying — supporting free‑text interaction with the knowledge base and integration with LLMs.
